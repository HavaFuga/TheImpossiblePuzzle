# The Impossible Puzzle

Welcome to **The Impossible Puzzle**, an intriguing gaming experience designed to challenge your wits and perception. Before you dive into the details, I want to ensure you approach this adventure with a fresh perspective. Don't spoil the surprise by reading too much ahead â€“ first give the game the chance to unfold its magic.

## Description

### Idea behind the game

**The Impossible Puzzle** is designed to be an engaging and progressively challenging game. It begins with seemingly straightforward levels, lulling players into a sense of ease. As they advance, however, the complexity intensifies. To add an extra layer of challenge, each level incorporates simulations of various color blindness conditions, providing a dynamic and immersive experience.

### How?
The game itself is a normal sliding puzzle we know from childhood. The small square puzzle, where you have to order the numbers 1-15 where the missing 16 gives you the opportunity to slide the other numbers into place.x
As the level progress you get images/colour-hues you have to order. 
The algorithm behind the color blindness simulation leverages the open-source code from [daltonlens.org](https://www.daltonlens.org/), ensuring accurate and effective transformation of images. By incorporating this algorithm, we aim to raise awareness of color vision deficiencies and make the game accessible to a broader audience.

### Results

The game progresses through levels of increasing difficulty, introducing players to color blindness simulations such as Protanopia, Deuteranopia, and Tritanopia. The ultimate challenge lies in the "Impossible Level," where the puzzle becomes a black-and-white enigma, pushing players to their limits.

### Small Discussion

#### What Works Well?

The integration of color blindness simulations adds a unique dimension to the game, making it both challenging and educational. Players experience firsthand how visual impairments can impact perception, fostering empathy and awareness.

#### Issues/Problems

Initially i wanted to create the algorithm to adjust the colours of the images accordingly to the selected colourblindness. But i realized quickly, that there isnt just some simple formula i could use for the rgb, colours as I have seen on this essay [Computerized simulation of color appearance for dichromats](http://vision.psychol.cam.ac.uk/jdmollon/papers/Dichromatsimulation.pdf) 
So i figured, until I fully understand the maths behind this, my time for this project will be up already. And because of the importance of the colour-blindness awarness that would be the biggest part of creating this inclusive gaming experience, i have decided to look for an algorithm that helps me out with this. And furthermore help the project to evolve to encompass a more comprehensive approach, ensuring accuracy and authenticity.
